I am an Applied Mathematician and AI Researcher currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at University College London (UCL) within the Hawkes Institute.

My current research lies at the intersection of modern artificial intelligence and medical image analysis. I focus on developing and applying advanced generative frameworks, specifically Diffusion and Flow models to medical data generation problems, such as image synthesis tasks.

**Open to collaboration:** I am always keen to explore research collaborations in flow and generative models (both theoretical and practical), image and data synthesis, general medical image problems, and world model understanding. More recently, I have become interested in RL and guidance techniques for the above. Feel free to reach out!

Prior to my PhD, I completed an MRes at the **University of Cambridge**, an MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing from the **University of Oxford**, and a BSc in Mathematics from the **University of Exeter**.
