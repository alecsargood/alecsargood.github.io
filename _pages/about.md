I am an Applied Mathematician and AI Researcher currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at University College London (UCL) within the Hawkes Institute.

My research lies at the intersection of modern artificial intelligence and complex image analysis. I focus on developing and applying advanced generative frameworks, specifically Diffusion and Flow models. I primarily apply these methods to medical image-to-image synthesis problems. Recently, my work has been accepted to **CVPR 2026** and **AAAI 2026**.


**Open to collaboration:** I am happy to discuss research collaborations in flow and generative models, image-to-image, tasks and world model applications. Reach me at [alec.sargood.23@ucl.ac.uk](mailto:alec.sargood.23@ucl.ac.uk).

Prior to my PhD, I completed an MRes in Biotechnology and Engineering at the **University of Cambridge**, an MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing from the **University of Oxford**, and a BSc in Mathematics from the **University of Exeter**.
