I am an Applied Mathematician and AI Researcher currently pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at University College London (UCL) within the Hawkes Institute. In 2026, I will be joining InstaDeep as a PhD Research Intern.

My research lies at the intersection of modern artificial intelligence and complex image analysis. I focus on developing and applying advanced generative frameworks—specifically Diffusion Models and Flow Matching. I primarily apply these methods to complex image-to-image synthesis and reconstruction tasks, such as MRI-to-PET translation and global tractography generation.

Recently, my work on generative global tractography (GenTract) was accepted to **CVPR 2026**, and a framework for MRI to Amyloid PET synthesis (CoCoLIT) was accepted to **AAAI 2026**.

Prior to my PhD, I completed an MRes in Biotechnology and Engineering at the **University of Cambridge**, focusing on probabilistic machine learning and information theory. I also hold an MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing from the **University of Oxford**, and a BSc (Hons) in Mathematics from the **University of Exeter**.
